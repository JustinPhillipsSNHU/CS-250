I interpret user needs by discovering requirements from the stakeholders of the project or the clients who will receive access to the project. Then I 
parse and prioritize the features related to those requirements such that priority needs are met first. A good method of doing this is to create user stories
that capture the perspective of a particular class of user, their goals, and their percieved avenue of achieving them from a UI/UX standpoint. User stories
help organize this information in a way where it can be used to drive development and feature implementation.

I approach developing programs by organizing my backlog then programming features in accordance to it. I hope to incorporate more of the Agile methodology,
as things like Scrum and kanban seem very useful in a team environment, and I would like to practice pair programming to learn more much more quickly in relation
to a particular development team and its practices, as well as to get myself up to industry standards. Test driven development also strikes me as very important.
Testing my features extensively to refine them will ensure quality in the product, and I feel like many of the software I interact with daily lack adequate testing
or general feature completeness. Iterative development will also allow refinement over time while maintaining a reasonable release window.

Being a good team member in software development means communicating my ideas, listening to others' contributions, seeking understanding, collaborating with my
team, communicating openly, fostering empathy, being adaptable, seeking and providing constructive feedback, and doing my part to contribute to the final product.
I think communication is key in all jobs I've had to date, and I expect no different in a development team.
